# Rock-Paper-Scissors
# Understand
the project rrequires me to write a javascript script that enables the rock-paper-scissors game. the general rule is that rock beats scissors, paper beats rocks and scissors beat papers.
# Plan
1. my code doesn't require a UI. the game will be played in my browser's console.
2. my code doesn't require an input from the user rather uses the arguments passed to it while coding.
3. the disered output is that the computer and the user which is will use the arguments passed to it can play the rock-paper-scissors game.
4. my algorithm will be written as a Psuedo Code in the Js script.
